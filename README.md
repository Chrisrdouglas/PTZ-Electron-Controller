# PTZ-Electron-Controller
A PTZ Camera controller application that uses a Wii Nunchuck, to control the camera. Currently the only supported camera is the Panasonic AW-HN40.

# Why I made this
* Because [this](https://na.panasonic.com/us/audio-video-solutions/broadcast-cinema-pro-video/camera-controllers/aw-rp150-touchscreen-remote-camera-controller) has a MSRP of $4,700.
* And [this](https://na.panasonic.com/us/audio-video-solutions/broadcast-cinema-pro-video/camera-controllers/aw-rp60-compact-remote-ptz-camera-controller) has a MSRP of $2,375
* Because I'm unemployed
    * I need something to do until I find a job
    * If you're hiring then here's a [link to my resume](http://jobshirt.us/)


# What's Next?
I'm probably going to keep restructuring the code to make it more adaptable to other cameras and controllers. The idea I have right now is to make it so that I can quickly add any controller I might need. After that I'll try to make the interface look better.
